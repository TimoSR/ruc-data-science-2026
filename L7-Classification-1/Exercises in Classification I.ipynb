    "In this exercise, we will use the titanic dataset to build a KNN classifier for the target variable `Survived`. In this exercise, all the necessary steps are broken down into small individual task you should do. So, do the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load in the titanic dataset (on Moodle as \"titanic_survival_data.csv\"), select the columns \"Pclass\", \"Sex\", \"Age\", and \"Fare\" for the feature set X and \"Survived\" for the target variable y.\n",
    "2. For the columns \"Age\" and \"Fare\", replace the missing values with the column's mean.\n",
    "3. Turn the variables \"Pclass\" and \"Sex\" into dummy variables.\n",
    "4. Do a train-test split of the data with 20% for testing. Use random state 962.\n",
    "5. Scale the X training dataset, using the standard scaler.\n",
    "6. Transform the X test dataset with the same scaler fitted in task 5.\n",
    "7. Train KNN models for multiple K's\n",
    "8. Train KNN models for K from 2 to 50 and plot the train and test precision and recall.\n",
    "9. Select the K above 5 with the highest precision and the K above 5 with the highest recall and retrain two models for these values of K\n",
    "10. For the two models trained in 9, create the confusion matrix and calculate, accuracy precision recall, and f-1 score."

    "1. Clean the `income` variable such that it has only two values (for instance by using `str.replace` to remover the `.`).\n",

    "3. Create X and y dataset and split the datasets into training and testing sets\n",
    "4. Train a KNN classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 - try out some different Ks \n",
    "5. Train a logistic regression classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the KNN classifier.\n",
    "6. Train a decision tree classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the previous classifiers.\n",
    "7. Train a random forest classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the previous classifiers.\n",
    "8. Train a AdaBoost classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the previous classifiers.\n",
    "9. (Optional) Can you improve any of the models by balancing the `income` variable?"
