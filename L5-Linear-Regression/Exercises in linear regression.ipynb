    "\n",
    "Load in the \"EnergyEfficiency.csv\" data (on Moodle). It is data about energy efficiency of buildings, more specifically it is about predicting the heating load and cooling load of building based on a set of features about the buildings. It is retrieved from UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Energy efficiency](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/242/energy+efficiency).\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. Do a visualization of the relationship/correlation between the variables `SurfaceArea` and `HeatingLoad`, with `HeatingLoad` as the dependent variable (y variable).\n",
    "2. Is there a correlation between `SurfaceArea` and `HeatingLoad`? If so, what is the strength of it, and is it statistically significant? Does this make sense to you, if `SurfaceArea` is the surface area of a building and the `HeatingLoad` is how much energy it takes to heat up the building?\n",
    "3. Add `hue = \"OverallHeight\"` to the scatterplot you did as an answer to question 1. Assuming that `OeverallHeight` represent the height of the building, does it change your answer to the last question of 2?\n",
    "4. Train a simple linear regression model with `SurfaceArea` as independent variable (x) and `HeatingLoad` as dependent variable (y).\n",
    "5. What does the model say about the change in `HeatingLoad` when the `SurfaceArea` goes up by 1 unit?\n",
    "6. Add the linear regression line to a scatterplot of `SurfaceArea` and `HeatingLoad`.\n",
    "7. Evaluate how good your simple linear regression model is. Hint: Chose one or several measures to evaluate your model.\n",
    "8. Subset your data such that you only have houses with \"OverallHeight=7\" and train a new simple linear regression model with `SurfaceArea` as independent variable and `HeatingLoad` as dependent variable. How good is this model compared to the on trained on the full dataset?"
