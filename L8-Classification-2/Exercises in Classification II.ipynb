    "In this exercise, we will use the titanic dataset to build different classifiers for the target variable `Survived`. In this exercise, all the necessary steps are broken down into small individual task you should do. Note that the first 6 tasks are the same as Exercise 1 from last time, so you can just copy-paste your code from that notebook. Do the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load in the titanic dataset (on Moodle as \"titanic_survival_data.csv\"), select the columns \"Pclass\", \"Sex\", \"Age\", and \"Fare\" for the feature set X and \"Survived\" for the target variable y.\n",
    "2. For the columns \"Age\" and \"Fare\", replace the missing values with the column's mean.\n",
    "3. Turn the variables \"Pclass\" and \"Sex\" into dummy variables.\n",
    "4. Do a train-test split of the data with 20% for testing. Use random state 962.\n",
    "5. Scale the X training dataset, using the standard scaler.\n",
    "6. Transform the X test dataset with the same scaler fitted in task 5.\n",
    "7. Train a decision tree model on the data with \"Survived\" as the response variable.\n",
    "8. Create the confusion matrix and calculate, accuracy precision recall, and f-1 score for this model.\n",
    "9. Train simple Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost models on the data with \"Survived\" as the response variable.\n",
    "10. Create the confusion matrix and calculate, accuracy precision recall, and f-1 score for the above models.\n",
    "11. Use a sampling technique (under, over or SMOTE) to improve either the Random Forest, AdaBoost, or XGBoost model. Create the confusion matrix and calculate, accuracy precision recall, and f-1 score for the new model.\n",
    "12. Due hyper-parameter tuning to improve the above model. Create the confusion matrix and calculate, accuracy precision recall, and f-1 score for the new model."

    "1. Clean the `income` variable such that it has only two values (for instance by using `str.replace` to remover the `.`).\n",

    "4. Train a KNN classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 - try out some different Ks \n",
    "5. Train a logistic regression classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the KNN classifier.\n",
    "6. Train a decision tree classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the previous classifiers.\n",
    "7. Train a random forest classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the previous classifiers.\n",
    "8. Train a AdaBoost classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the previous classifiers.\n",
